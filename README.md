# Instalation
make a database in your dbms and name it just like my sql name. then import the sql file in this repo to your dbms.

# Admin and user.
Admin account : 
  - username : admin
  - password : admin

you can see the user password and username because its not hashed.

# Server Requirements
PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
